# SPA "Square meter" (JavaScript)

In this application, you can choose an apartment according to the filter parameters and send a bid.

## What is done:
_MVC and Component Approach_

* Router: depending on the request, it will show the component with the desired "page"

* Rendering a filter with data from the server (fetch request)

* Rendering cards (by default on page load, and also after applying a filter)

* Rendering a Component with a separate apartment, calling a modal window on it and creating an order

* Component "Favorites": implemented adding cards with apartments to favorites (writing data to localStorage)
