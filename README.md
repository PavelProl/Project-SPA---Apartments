# Single Page Application (JavaScript)

In this application, you can choose an apartment according to the filter parameters and send a bid.

## What is done:
_MVC and Component Approach_

* Router: depending on the request, it will show the component with the required "page"

* Render a Filter with data from the server (fetch)

* Render Cards (by default on page load, as well as after applying a filter)

* Render a Component with a separate apartment, call the Modal window on it and create an order

* "Favorites" component: implemented adding cards with apartments to favorites (writing data to localStorage)
